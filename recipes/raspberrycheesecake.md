This is by far the best raspberry cheeesecake recipe I've tried so far. The perfect guilty pleasure treat!

### Ingredients

- 1 cup crushed graham crackers
- 2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter
- 1 and 3/4 cups granulated sugar
- 1 clamshell raspberries (6 oz)
- 32 oz cream cheese
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract or paste
- 4 large eggs
- A pinch of salt

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350F. Wrap exterior of a 9-inch springform pan in two layers of foil.
2. Stir together graham crackers, melted butter, and 2 tbsp sugar. Press mixture onto bottom of pan. Bake until set(~ 10 minutes). Let cool at room temp. Reduce oven temp to 325F.
3. Blend raspberries in a food processor and pass puree through a sieve. Whisk in 2 tbsp sugar.
4. Mix cream cheese in an electric mixer until fluff (~ 3 mins). Add remaining 1 and 1/2 cups sugar and salt and vanilla. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing each until just combined. Pour cream cheese filling over crust.
5. Add droplets of raspberry sauce on top. With a toothpick, swirl sauce into filling.
6. Set springform pan inside a large, shallow roasting pan. Transfer to oven. Pour boiling water into roasting pan to reach halfway up sides of pan. Bake until cake is set but still slightly wobbly in center (~60 to 65 minutes).
7. Let cake cool completely. Refrigerate uncovered overnight. Before unmolding, run a knife around edge of cake.
